# Tetrapak
A small content pack for balatro, Not limited or themed, just what I think is cool.
Currently a few jokers and a few spectrals.
Also add a new type of joker, the curse joker, an actively detrimental joker gained only through special means. 

## Config 
On first launch, creates a config.lua in the mod files, you can edit this for better control over the added content.
