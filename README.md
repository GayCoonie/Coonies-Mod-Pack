# Coonie's Balatro Modpack
A curated collection of Balatro mods made by many wonderful members of the community. Collected by GaCoonie. 

These are basically just the mods I personally play with. Sharing because it's a relatively large amount that I know all work together, and also because it's curated towards a vannilia+ game experience where things can get nuts, but only if you want them to. It's mostly just more of the same from the base game, and a lot of interesting spins on it without straying too much from Balatro as we know it. All told once I finish putting this together there will be over 700 jookers, over 100 vouchers, and a couple choice additions to spectrals, planets, and tarots. I don't take credit for any of this of course. I just found all these mods and think they ought to be in one place.
